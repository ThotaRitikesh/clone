         <b>  You spent months planning your renovation and found the perfect
          contractor. Now you have to get your renovation approved by the board.
          You'll need to submit all the required documents the first time or the
          approval process could drag out for months. Remember the board package
          you assembled when you wanted to buy your home? Welcome back. </b>

             <b> 1. Alteration Agreement</b> Tell your managing agent that you would
              like to perform some renovations and ask for the alteration
              application. It will remind you of a Co-op Application Package:
              reams of paperwork to fill out and checks to be written. The
              alteration agreement explains a building's rules regarding
              renovations and the documentation you need to submit to the
              managing agent, who will work with the board to have the project
              approved.

             <b> 2. Insurance, Insurance and More Insurance</b> Every contractor and
              subcontractor on the job must provide you with a certificate of
              insurance naming you, the managing agent and the co-op corporation
              (or condo association) as additional insured parties under the
              policy. If your contractor damages your apartment or the building,
              each additional insured can make a claim directly to the
              contractor's insurance company. The certificate of insurance must
              state that the contractor has liability insurance (the minimum in
              New York City buildings is generally $1 million per occurrence and
              $2 million aggregate), workers compensation and disability
              insurance. <br> <br />If the contractor or any subcontractors lack one
              of these types of insurance, the managing agent won't let them
              work in the building and won't approve your ronerous and many
              contractors who don't regularly have projects in the city don't
              carry such high and expensive levels of insurancesenovation. New York's
              insurance requirements are particularly .

            <p>
             <b>3. Licensed Contractors and Subcontractors</b>  Your contractor and
              subcontractors must submit proof of their NYC license with your
              alteration application. Any electrician, general contractor and
              plumber must be licensed by the Department of Buildings to perform
              renovation work in your building. You say your contractor is
              licensed in Long Island or New Jersey? That won't work in New
              York. If your building was built prior to 1978, your contractor
              will also be required to show that his is an Environmental
              Protection Agency lead-certified firm.

            <p>
             <b> 4. Department of Buildings Work Permits (If applicable)</b> If your
              renovation requires building permits you will need to submit
              architectural plans along with your alteration agreement. Your
              architect or engineer must be licensed in New York. Expect to pay
              the co-op's architect an hourly fee to review your architect's
              drawings. Be sure to ask what the co-op architect's hourly fee is
              and how much time he or she will take to review your plans. For
              one of my clients, the co-op architect charged $300 an hour and
              said the firm took four hours to review a one-page drawing.

            <p>
             <b> 5. Money</b> The alteration agreement should make clear the
              application fees, security deposits and, sometimes, building
              inconvenience fees you need to pay. Some co-ops demand that you
              pay it a percentage of your construction costs to compensate the
              building's staff for having to facilitate your contractor's work
              (as in making the service elevator available.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
             <b> 6. Patience and Fortitude Managing </b>agents are notoriously
              unresponsive and slow to process alteration agreements, especially
              if they require architectural drawings. We had a customer whose
              managing agent took more than six months to approve a
              straightforward installation of a washing machine.
              <br /> <br> The best way to remove any objections to your alteration
              agreement is to submit every document that is required exactly the
              way the managing agent wants it. Now, sometimes what he or she
              wants will seem, well, illogical. Several managing agents, for
              example, mandated that we use their building's preferred plumber,
              even though that person wanted to charge $5,000 for a $2,000 job
              and didn't return phone calls. <br /> <br>
              If you think that some of the requests are ridiculous, consider
              raising your concerns after the renovation has been completed. Bad
              mouthing the managing agent or approval process to other
              shareholders or the board when your alteration application is
              under review or the job is underway may draw unnecessary scrutiny,
              as managing agents have wide discretion in terms of recommending
              to the board that your renovation be approved (or not). They can
              also make your life miserable during the job itself either by
              instructing the building staff to not be helpful to your
              contractor and/or by enforcing every building rule to its maximum.
